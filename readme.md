# Star Wars Wiki

Hi there 👋🏼  
This is a very simply Star Wars Wiki, I taked the idea from the **Mouredev Monthly App Challenge 2022** (link of the challenge at the end of this readme 👇🏼)

- ✅ Use the API [https://swapi.dev/](https://swapi.dev/)
- ✅ Free choice design.
- ✅ Must show a list and details of every Character. (I decided to make a grid with cards)
- ✅ The list must be paged.
- ✅ Add a search filter.
- ✅ OPTIONAL: Detail of films, vehicles, planets...

  give it a try: [play!](https://twentyeight07.github.io/Star-Wars-Wiki/)
